## The Technical Challenge

Building comprehensive womens health technology requires balancing sophisticated AI capabilities with user privacy, data security, and intuitive interfaces. Here is how we approached these challenges at Sanicle.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Stack

```typescript
// Next.js 15 with React 19
const techStack = {
  framework: "Next.js 15",
  ui: "React 19",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  state: "Redux Toolkit",
  realtime: "WebSocket"
};
```

### AI Integration Layer

The integration with IBM watsonx AI presented unique challenges:

**Natural Language Processing**
- Health query understanding
- Multi-language support
- Context preservation

**Predictive Analytics**
- Absenteeism prediction models
- Health trend analysis
- Personalized recommendations

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

```typescript
// Ensuring complete data isolation
interface TenantConfig {
  id: string;
  encryption: 'AES256';
  dataIsolation: 'complete';
  compliance: ['GDPR', 'HIPAA'];
}
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

- Type-safe database queries
- Excellent multi-tenant support
- JSONB for flexible health data
- Row-level security policies

### Real-Time Features

- WebSocket for instant notifications
- Server-sent events for dashboard updates
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX

## Security and Privacy First

### End-to-End Encryption

```typescript
// All sensitive health data encrypted
const encryptHealthData = (data: HealthRecord) => {
  return encrypt(data, {
    algorithm: 'AES-256-GCM',
    key: deriveKey(tenant.id, user.id)
  });
};
```

### GDPR Compliance

- Right to erasure implementation
- Data portability features
- Consent management system
- Audit logging

## Lessons Learned

**Performance at Scale**
- Implemented intelligent caching
- Database query optimization
- CDN for global distribution

**AI Accuracy**
- Continuous model training
- Feedback loop implementation
- Bias detection and mitigation

**User Experience**
- Progressive disclosure of features
- Mobile-first design approach
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)

## Impact Metrics

- 99.9% uptime achieved
- Less than 200ms average response time
- 40% reduction in HR workload
- 85% user satisfaction rate

## Open Source Contributions

While Sanicle.Cloud is proprietary, we have open-sourced several components:
- Health data visualization library
- Multi-tenant authentication module
- GDPR compliance toolkit

## Future Technical Roadmap

- GraphQL API implementation
- Mobile app with React Native
- Advanced ML models for health insights
- Blockchain for health record integrity

*Building technology for womens health is not just about codeâ€”it is about creating solutions that genuinely improve lives while respecting privacy and autonomy.*
