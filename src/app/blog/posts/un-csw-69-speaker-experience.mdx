## An Honor to Speak at the United Nations

Being selected as a speaker at the UN CSW 69 Beyond Beijing 30 Conference was both humbling and empowering. The opportunity to showcase how AI technology can effectively address workplace gender inequities aligned perfectly with my work at Sanicle and FreePeriod.

## Key Points from My Presentation

### The Current Landscape
- Workplace gender inequities persist globally
- Women's health needs often overlooked in corporate settings
- Technology can bridge these gaps effectively

### AI-Powered Solutions
- Predictive analytics for health-related absenteeism
- Personalized health support through AI assistants
- Data-driven insights for HR policy improvements

### Real-World Impact
Through Sanicle.Cloud, we've demonstrated:
- 40% reduction in health-related productivity loss
- Improved employee satisfaction scores
- Better workplace inclusion metrics

## The Power of Technology for Social Good

This experience reinforced my belief that technology, when thoughtfully applied, can create meaningful social change. The intersection of AI/ML and women's health is not just a technical challenge—it's an opportunity to build a more equitable future.

## Looking Forward

The connections made and insights gained at CSW 69 continue to inform my work. As we develop new features for both Sanicle and FreePeriod, we're committed to maintaining this focus on using technology to address real-world gender inequities.

*The future is not just about building better technology—it's about building technology that makes the world better for everyone.*
